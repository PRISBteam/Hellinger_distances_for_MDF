# Hellinger_distances_for_MDF
This jupyter (.ipynb) notebook is written as a tool for automatic detection and quantification of mesostructure (including shear bands) based on the measurement of the Hellinger distances between random and actual misorientation distribution function (MDF) experimentally obtained by EBSD or X-ray microscopy.
